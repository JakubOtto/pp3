# Programming Workshop III
Welcome to the Programming Workshop III repository. This repository contains materials and exercises I studied and finished about learning Java from scratch. Below is an overview of the sections and the topics covered.

# In this workshop, I learned a wide range of fundamental Java programming concepts, including:

- Introduction to Java and Development Setup: Setting up the development environment and understanding basic programming concepts.
- Classes and Objects: Learning about classes, objects, fields, methods, and constructors, and how they form the backbone of Java programming.
- Class Structure: Delving into the anatomy of a class, understanding the role of each component.
- Data Encapsulation: Using access modifiers, and getter/setter methods to protect and manage data within classes.
- Conceptual Modeling: Translating real-world problems into Java classes and objects, focusing on designing effective software models.
- Aggregation and Composition: Understanding the relationships between objects and how they can be composed to form complex systems.
- Inheritance and Polymorphism: Learning about inheritance hierarchies, method overriding, and polymorphic behavior to create flexible and reusable code.
- Abstract Classes and Interfaces: Exploring abstract classes and interfaces to define common behaviors and design contracts.
- Testing and Assessment: Regular assessments through mock tests to evaluate understanding and mastery of topics.

### Each section in this repository contains relevant code examples, exercises, and notes to reinforce the concepts learned. Feel free to explore each directory to find more detailed information and practical applications of the topics covered.
